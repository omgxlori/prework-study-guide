# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide webpage contains coding notes about 4 different topics: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

This project was built in order to organize my notes and help me study for my course.

While building this page, I have learned fundamental codes for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript and how to enter in each code accordingly in VS Code. Once built out, I learned how to save my work in Git Bash and GitHub and close out issues.
